# Machine Learning Project README

This README file provides an overview of the machine learning project, including its purpose, key features, and how to use it.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build several common **supervised learning model** that can predict certain outcomes based on input data. The project is split into four parts: data preprocessing, data analysis, prediction, and evaluation. Each part is designed to ensure that the model is accurate and reliable.

## Key Features

Here are the key features of each part of the project:

### Data Preprocessing

In this part, the input data is processed to prepare it for analysis and modeling. The data preprocessing step includes dealing with **NULL values**, **One-hot** encoding.

### Data Analysis

Data analysis is performed to identify patterns in the data and to explore the relationships between variables and . This part includes data visualization techniques such as pie charts, histograms, bar charts, and heat maps to display correlations between variables.

### Prediction

The prediction part involves building a supervised learning model that can predict the target variable based on the input data. Several algorithms are used, including **k-nearest neighbors**, **decision tree**, **random forest**, and **logistic regression**.

### Evaluation

In the evaluation part, the performance of the model is assessed using various metrics such as **recall**, **precision**, **false positive rate (FPR)**, **true positive rate (TPR)**, and **PRC AUC curve**. These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy, precision, and reliability of the model.

## Conclusion

This machine learning project provides a comprehensive approach to building a supervised learning model that can predict outcomes based on input data. Aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning.
